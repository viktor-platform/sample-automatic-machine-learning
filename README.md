# AutoML app
Sample app to show how easy it can be to distribute versatile machine learning solutions to people with no experience in it

The app contains a toggle to distinguish between classification and regression machine learning. It has an input
field for the name/path of your .csv so it can find it. It has a target where the column that needs to be learned
an be distinguished. It has different analysis plots that can be visualized. Lastly it has a table input at the bottom
where new data can be put in, after which the model can predict the new property for you.
